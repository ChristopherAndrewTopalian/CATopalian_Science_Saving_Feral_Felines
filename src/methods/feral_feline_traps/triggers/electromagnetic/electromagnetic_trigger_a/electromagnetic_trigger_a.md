### Coil of Wire:
We use copper breadboard wire.

### Neodymium Cylinder Magnets
We use neodymium cylinder magnets stacked together in a row.  

# Power
Even with only 1 D Battery, this Electromagnet is powerful enough to trigger the trap, by pulling the neodymium magnets into the center hole of the coil of wire.

This design is very simple and easy to make and requires only a small amount of current and voltage.

# Summary
This design is simply a coil of wire with current running through it to pull the trigger pin away from its stationary position to activate the trap.  

# Sensitivity
Since we are using the powerful electromagnet and powerful neodymium magnets, we can set the trigger to activate upon a very low pressure, which is very important for kittens!  

This trap is efficient at triggering even for the weight of a newly born Kitten!  

The issue with many traps on the market today is that they sometimes don't trigger for kittens, due to the kitten's low weight.  

But, by utilizing the electromagnet we can activate the electromagnet by simply having the cat connect the paperclip with the battery terminal through a metal strip.

In this way, the kitten only has to barely step on the metal plate, to activate the electromagnet, which triggers the neodymium cylinder magnets to be pulled from their stationary position, and thus the trap door will close.
